var expect = chai.expect;

//logs nothing... need to make the method static or something?
describe('createDeck', function() {
    it('should create a new instance of Deck')
})

//logs nothing
expect(myDeck).to.have.lengthOf(52);

//QUESTIONS:

//can you test a function within a class - would you create
//an instance of the
//class and then test the method?

//feels like finding a lot of diff syntax
//ie
//const expect = chai.expect; v
//vs
//const chai = require('chai'),
//expect = chai.expect;

//where do you put the export module? immediately after 
//the unit you're testing or at the very end of the file?

//difference between mocha and chai

//difference between assert and expect
